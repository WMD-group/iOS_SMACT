# iOS SMACT

Interactive educational / outreach app for generating new perovskite structures from element combinations inspired by [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT).

It was used as part of the 2018 Royal Society Summer Exhibition [Code for Creation](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2018/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/code-for-creation/).

# App preview

The app shows an introductory video, introducing the background of the materials design challenge:

Elements of the periodic table can be chosen by the user to create a (potentially new!) perovskite crystal structure, with the help of "Thomas" the supercomputer:
